# React Router Template

This is just a template made with ready made routers in React for easy access.
It's literally like 10 lines away from the default initialized app by the `create-react-app` command.

## To add a Router

Open `src/App.js` and add a line `<Route exact path="/YourRoute" component={YourComponent} />`
That is it, and it should now work once you run it.

Provided of course you import the component for that route too.
